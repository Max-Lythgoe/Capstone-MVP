# Capstone Idea
My app will be an ecommerce site similar to bestbuy/apple, selling electronic items. Main page will display a list of featured items, when an item is clicked they can view it in greater detail and then add it to their cart.

# MVPs
* Users can view a list of featured items
* Users can click on an item which will expand it or open in it's own window with more info
* Users can add an item to their cart and later view their cart with a total price listed (with the option to remove items from cart as well)

# Other Features I'd Like to Add (if I have the time)
* Users can search for items
* Filter items by category
* Login which will save user data
* Cool animations for elements on home page
# Database Model
